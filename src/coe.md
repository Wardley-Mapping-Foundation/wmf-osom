## Introduction

The Correction of Error (CoE) process was been inspired by the [AWS
Well Architected](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.coe.en.html)
framework, and acts as a [systematic method of
learning](/doctrine#do-we-use-systematic-mechanisms-of-learning) for
the organisation's service network.

## The CoE document

A Correction of Error (CoE) document should be published by the
Service Manager for the service to which it applies. A CoE document
should be published whenever a problem occurs - it shouldn't be
necessary for the problem to have impacted the users of the service.

The CoE document should contain:

* What the problem was
* What the impact of the problem was
* What the root cause of the problem was
* Data that supports the root cause analysis
* What value tradeoffs were made that led to the problem
* The value tradeoffs that need to be avoided in the future
* Lessons that were learned
* Corrective actions that have been, or will be taken

## The Correction of Errors review

The [executive](/executive) should [conduct regular
reviews](/executive#review-correction-of-error-documents) with all
service managers of the unreviewed, published CoE documents. This
review allows other service managers to benefit from the experience of
the error, without being a part of the service team that experienced
the error.
