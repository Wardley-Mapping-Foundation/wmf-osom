## Introduction

An important concept from Wardley mapping that OSOM is built upon
heavily is the idea of service evolution.

Every organisation should aim to address its users' needs with [novel](#novel)
offerings - they are how an organisation differentiates itself from its
competitors. However, they compose other services to achieve that,
some of which will be built around [bespoke](#bespoke) components, some around [products](#products), and still more that use [commodities](#commodity).
