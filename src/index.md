## Introduction to OSOM

The Organised Services Operating Model (OSOM) is a template operating model to help organisations who are adopting a service-based approach. This is in opposition to a functional model, where capabilities are grouped by skills and ownership of the delivery to users is an endeavour shared between those functions.

The operating model has evolved over time by rigorously applying [Wardley's Doctrine](/doctrine) to multiple organisations, and finding generally applicable organisational patterns that have been deployed repeatedly.

The key components of OSOM are an executive capability that provides oversight and governance, and a network of services that progress through a simple [service lifecycle](/lifecycle) that is compatible with the [Government Digital Service's](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) [service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

## A template operating model

OSOM is a template operating model. Each organisation is different, and few organisations would be directly mappable onto OSOM directly. Instead, it forms a general approach that should carefully adapted.

The key to adapting an operating model for any given organisation is to be aware of the trade-offs that are being made with each compromise, both positive and negative. That way, governance can be established to balance the negative consequences.

## Previous documentation

This site is an evolution of the original [OSOM
documentation](http://stance.consulting/osom/). While the
documentation almost certainly remains incomplete, this site takes
precedence and therefore overrides any contradictions between the two.

## Elements of OSOM

### The executive

The [OSOM executive](/executive) both governs the network of services
and holds the managers of those services to account through the
variety of mechanisms documented in the terms of reference.

The executive also has a role in advocating and monitoring the
adoption of [doctrine](/doctrine) throughout the organisation, which is a
collection of 40 universally useful patterns of behaviour.

### The service network

[OSOM services](/services/) address the needs of users. For any given service, the
users may be external to the organisation, internal, or a mixture of
both.

Each service is built & operated by a Service Manager, who is
accountable for the service and the team it requires in all its
lifecycle phases - from discovery until its eventual retirement.
