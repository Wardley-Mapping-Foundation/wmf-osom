## Introduction

The Organised Services Operating Model (OSOM) is a template operating
model to help organisations who are adopting a service-based approach
to delivering to their users. This is in opposition to a functional
model, where capabilities are grouped by skills and ownership of the
delivery to users is an endeavour shared between those functions.

The operating model has evolved over time by rigorously applying [Wardley's
Doctrine](/doctrine) to multiple organisations, and finding generally
applicable organisational patterns.

The key components of OSOM are an executive capability that oversees
and governs a network of services as they progress through a simple
[service lifecycle](/lifecycle) that is compatible with the [Government
Digital Service's](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) [service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

## The Executive

The [OSOM executive](/executive) both governs the network of services
and holds the managers of those services to account through the
variety of mechanisms documented in the terms of reference.

The executive also has a role in advocating and monitoring the
adoption of [doctrine](/doctrine) throughout the organisation, which is a
collection of 40 universally useful patterns of behaviour.
