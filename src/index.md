## Introduction to OSOM

The Organised Services Operating Model (OSOM) is a template operating
model to help organisations who are adopting a service-based
approach. This is in opposition to a functional model, where
capabilities are grouped by skills and ownership of the delivery to
users is an endeavour shared between those functions.

The operating model has evolved over time by rigorously applying [Wardley's
Doctrine](/doctrine) to multiple organisations, and finding generally
applicable organisational patterns.

The key components of OSOM are an executive capability that oversees
and governs a network of services as they progress through a simple
[service lifecycle](/lifecycle) that is compatible with the [Government
Digital Service's](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) [service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

## Previous documentation

This site is an evolution of the original [OSOM
documentation](http://stance.consulting/osom/). While the
documentation almost certainly remains incomplete, this site takes
precedence and therefore overrides any contradictions between the two.

## The executive

The [OSOM executive](/executive) both governs the network of services
and holds the managers of those services to account through the
variety of mechanisms documented in the terms of reference.

The executive also has a role in advocating and monitoring the
adoption of [doctrine](/doctrine) throughout the organisation, which is a
collection of 40 universally useful patterns of behaviour.

## The service network

OSOM Services address the needs of users. For any given service, the
users may be external to the organisation, internal, or a mixture of
both.

Each service is built & operated by a Service Manager, who is
accountable for the service and the team it requires in all its
lifecycle phases - from discovery until its eventual retirement.

Services can and should depend upon each other, forming a network of
services, rather than a heirarchy of management.
