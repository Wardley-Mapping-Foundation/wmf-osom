subtitle: Service Assessments

---
To help ensure the smooth running of a service network, the executive needs to assess each [service](/services/) regularly. This assessment can be conducted directly by the executive or delegated to a team of experts assembled for the task.

The primary purpose of the assessment is to understand how well the service meets the user needs, but it will also examine how the service is being managed and how well it has adopted the [doctrine](/doctrine/).

While the purpose of the assessment remains the same, the nature of the assessment will change as the service progresses through the [lifecycle](/lifecycle/).

## After a discovery phase

When a [discovery phase](/lifecycle/#discovery) comes to its conclusion, an assessment will need to be conducted to determine the service should move on to an alpha stage or not.

This will mean that the service contract will have been tested with user research, and the service team will have a good idea about what will be needed to address the needs that have been identified.

There are three possible outcomes of a discovery phase:

1. The service is not required
2. More research is required, and a further discovery phase should be conducted
3. Unaddressed needs have been identified, and the service should progress to an [alpha](/lifecycle/#alpha) stage.

### The service is not required

A discovery could easily result in learning the service isn't a worthwhile pursuit. 

This could be because of several reasons. For example, it may be that the needs are not pressing enough to tackle - they don't really exist, or it might be that the needs are too far outside of the scope for the organisation to address.

### More research is required

Another possible outcome of a discovery phase is that the research resulted in a requirement for more research.

An incremental funding model will often result in small, focused efforts rather than all-encompassing ones, making this a common outcome. When this happens, the things discovered in the previous discovery should be used to shape the round of discovery.

### Progress to alpha

When a service is ready to progress to alpha it has identified the needs it intends to address. This means the service contract has been clarified and updated where needed to reflect the latest understanding.

In order to progress to alpha, a budget will need to be allocated so that the service has appropriate funding. This _should_ be a consideration of the discovery phase.
