subtitle: Service Assessment Criteria

---
When conducting a [service assessment]({{ '/assessments' | url }}), the executive is free to choose which criteria to judge a service by. They are usually based on the [guides to better decisions]({{ '/doctrine' | url }}) and any relevant [guidance]({{ '/executive/#consider-publish-and-endorse-guidance' | url }}) or [mandates]({{ '/executive/#issue-mandates-to-manipulate-the-service-network' | url }}). They are also influenced by the nature of the service and its current [lifecycle stage]({{ '/lifecycle' | url }}).

The criteria used are included in the [service assessment report]({{ '/service-assessment-report' | url }}).
