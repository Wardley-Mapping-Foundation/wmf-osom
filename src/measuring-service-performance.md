All services should define measurements that help people understand if the service is performing as it should. 

When deciding upon which metrics are most appropriate for a service, consider the [user needs](/user-needs) that the service meets. A metric that is suitable for inclusion in the service contract is typically one that is directly relatable to those needs.

It may be that additional metrics are useful for the individual performing the role of the [Service Manager](/service-manager), or the team that works to keep the service operating. While those metrics are important, and nothing here should discourage anybody from collecting them, they shouldn't be confused with the metrics contained in the contract.
