subtitle: Establishing a new Service

---
There are two occasions likely to arise where a new service might be needed. The first is that a set of previously unmet needs is identified - this could be as a new product line for the end consumer, or it could be to enhance how internal services work. 

The second circumstance occurs when two or more existing services are addressing a need within their service boundary and the opportunity to remove duplication exists by consolidating that capability as a shared service that they - and other services could consume instead.

To establish the service in both cases, a service contract should be drafted, documenting the user needs and appointing a service manager.
