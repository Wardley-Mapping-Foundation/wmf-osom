subtitle: Service Lifecycle

---
The service lifecycle defines how services mature from an initial concept through to production and are eventually decommissioned. At each stage of the lifecycle, there can be different general expectations of performance and reliability, and there are different activities that need to occur.

## Discovery

In discovery, a service contract has been written that proposes answering some hypothetical user needs. Still, the goal of the phase is to understand the problem that needs to be solved and refine the service contract before entering the alpha phase.

In the discovery phase, none of the user needs of the contract is ever met.

For more information, see the GDS documentation on [discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works).

## Alpha

When a service is in its alpha phase, it tries to find a solution to the problem established in the service contract. In the alpha phase, potential implementations are being tested and validated to understand the most suitable approach. At the end of the alpha phase, the interface a service presents to the world is considered and established, which will allow the service contract to be refined before entering the beta phase.

In the alpha phase, it is expected that some of the user needs may be met some of the time.

For more information, see the GDS documentation on [alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works).

## Beta

A service in its beta phase is actively built to serve a set of user needs identified in discovery. In the beta phase, the approach decided upon in the alpha phase is adopted, and the primary focus is on the implementation and delivery of the service. This means that preparations are underway to operate the service as if it were live.

In the beta phase, it is expected that some of the user needs are met most of the time.

For more information, see the GDS documentation on [beta](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works).

## Live

A live service is actively being used by the users whose needs it is designed to meet. The service needs to meet its user needs, its operational goals and improve itself over time - either by meeting the needs of its users more effectively or by making the mechanism by which it meets those needs more efficient. Eventually, the service will be decommissioned, and the service should publish consideration of how users might migrate away from it.

In the live phase, it is expected that all of the user needs are met all of the time.

For more information, see the GDS documentation on [live](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works).

## Decommissioned

A decommissioned service is no longer operating. The reasons for its decommissioning should be recorded in its service contract to ensure that the organisation doesnâ€™t forget lessons that it may have learned from operating it.
