subtitle: OSOM services

OSOM services and the network of interactions they form are two key parts of OSOM, the other being the [executive](/executive).

The service network does the heavy lifting for the organisation. It delivers against the user needs that the organisation attempts to address for third parties or the needs that arise through tackling those.

They're not end-to-end silos or a transaction. They are discrete capabilities that can be assembled as components by other, increasingly higher-order capabilities, ultimately to present those customer journeys to users.

Services are managed by service managers and are periodically assessed by the executive - at minimum each time the service progresses to a new stage in its [lifecycle](/lifecycle/), but regularly once the service goes [live](/lifecycle/#live) also.

## Service managers

Service managers individually manage services. Ideally, the service manager would have the capability to deliver every element of their service - designing it, building or buying it, and then running it - however, in practice, they must build and manage a team capable of doing all of those things.

Service managers:

1. Are accountable for their service
2. Use the allocated service budget wisely
3. Build the team they need
4. Decide the way they run their team
5. Publish Correction of Error documents when problems arise

### Service managers are accountable for their service

Each service has a [contract](#service-contracts) that defines the service, the needs it meets, and how users consume it. Service managers are accountable for delivery against that contract. Within the bounds of that contract, they are free to deliver the service as they see fit. The service is autonomous and operates independently.

### Service managers use the allocated service budget wisely

Each service is allocated a budget by the [executive](/executive) and is responsible for ensuring it is used wisely. This budget should allow the service manager to build the team they need and perform any activities needed for its [lifecycle stage](/lifecycle).

### Service managers build the team they need

Services need different capabilities at different times. For example, a service in [discovery](/lifecycle/#discovery) will have more user researchers than a [live](/lifecycle/#live) service; a service in [alpha ](/lifecycle/#alpha)or [beta ](/lifecycle/#beta)will probably have more developers than a service that is live.

It is up to the service manager to staff the team as they see fit, with the people they need to perform the required activities. The cost of the team needs to be met from the budget that the service has been allocated.

### Service managers decide the way they run their team

Different types of services require different approaches for different stages of [evolution](/evolution/), and different [lifecycle](/lifecycle/) phases. A novel service that addresses user needs in a completely new way requires different project methodologies, people, and techniques from the operation of a product or the management of a contract from a third-party supplier.

For example, a service team building a beta web-based front-end that interacts with end-users requires a different set of approaches to an infrastructure cloud service that provides the front-end team with the machines it uses.

The service manager is accountable for deciding the most appropriate way to run their team for their particular service.

### Service managers publish Correction of Error documents when problems arise

Building and running a service is challenging at times, and issues and problems occur regularly. To help the organisation learn in a methodical, systematic way, service managers write about the problems they face in [Correction of Error](/coe/) documents

## Service contracts

Each service has a service contract, and that contract explains the critical information about the service:

1. What the service is and the [user needs](/user-needs) it meets
2. What [lifecycle stage](/lifecycle) the service is at
3. What evolutionary stage the service is at
4. How the service is used
5. What expectations of success and failure a customer can have
6. How the performance of the service is measured
7. How to get help when the service isn't performing as expected
8. What other services the service depends upon

## Service governance

To govern the network of services, the [executive](/executive) requires additional information about each service that helps them understand and make changes when needed.

1. A Wardley Map of how the service is delivered and the components it requires
2. The guidance that the service manager has rejected
