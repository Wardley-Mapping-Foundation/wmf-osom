## Introduction

OSOM services and the network of interactions they form are, are one
of the two key parts of OSOM, the other being the
[executive](/executive).

The service network does the heavy lifting for the organisation, and
delivers against the user needs that the organisation attempts to
address for third-parties, or the needs that arise through tackling
those.

They're not end-to-end silos, or a transaction. They are discrete
capabilities that can be assembled as components by other,
increasingly higher-order capabilities, ultimately to present those
customer journeys to users.

Services are managed by service managers, and are periodically assesed
by the executive - at minimum each time the service progresses to a new
stage in its [lifecycle](/lifecycle/), but regularly once the service goes
[live](/lifecycle/#live) also.

## Service managers

Services are individually managed by service managers. Ideally, the
service manager would have the capability to deliver every element of
their service - designing it, building or buying it, and then running
it - however, in practice they must build and manage a team capable of
doing all of those things.

Service managers:

1. Are accountable for their service
1. Use the allocated service budget wisely
1. Build the team they need
1. Decide the way they run their team
1. Publish Correction of Error documents when problems arise

### Service managers are accountable for their service

Each service has a [contract](#service-contracts) that defines the
service, and how users consume it. Service managers are accountable
for delivery against that contract.

### Service managers use the allocated service budget wisely

Each service is allocated a budget by the [executive](/executive), and
is responsible for ensuring it is used wisely. This budget should
allow the service manager to build the team they need, as well as
perform any activities needed for the service's [lifecycle
stage](/lifecycle).


### Service managers build the team they need

Services need different capabilities at different times. For example,
a service in [discovery](/lifecycle/#discovery) will have more user
researchers than a service that is [live](/lifecycle/#live).

It is up to the service manager to staff the team as they see fit,
with the people they need to perform the required activities. The cost
of the team needs to be met from the budget that the service has been
allocated.

### Service managers decide the way they run their team

Different types of services required different approaches for
different stages of [evolution](/evolution/). A novel
service that addresses user needs in a completely new way requires
different project methodologies, different people, and different
techniques from the operation of a product that is bought from a third
party supplier.

For example, a service team that is building a beta web-based
front-end that interacts with end-users requires a different set of
approaches to a infrastructure cloud service that provides the
front-end team with the machines it uses.

The service manager is accountable for deciding the most appropriate
way to run their team for their particular service.

### Service managers publish Correction of Error documents when problems arise

Building and running a service is challenging at times, and issues and
problems occur regularly. To help the organisation learn in a
methodical, systematic way, service managers write about the problems
they face in [Correction of Error](/coe/) documents 

## Service contracts

Each service has a service contract, and that contract explains the
critical information about the service:

1. What the service is and the user needs it meets
1. What [lifecycle stage](/lifecycle) the service is at
1. How the service is used
1. What expectations of success and failure a customer can have
1. How the performance of the service is measured
1. How to get help when the service isn't performing as expected
1. What other services the service depends upon

## Service governance

In order to govern the network of services, the
[executive](/executive) requires some additional information about
each service that helps them to understand and make changes when
needed. 

1. A Wardley Map of how the service is delivered, and the components
   it requires
1. Guidance that has been rejected by the service manager
